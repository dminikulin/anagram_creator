# Anagram creator

Little program for manual anagram creation, written with React + TS + Tailwind.

How to use:

1. Enter your original sentence.
2. The field for anagram will appear automatically. Start entering the anagram.
3. During your typing, you will see your original sentence and the used symbols will be highlighted in gray.
4. You can select if your anagram will be strict or not. A non-strict anagram is the one that uses characters from original sentence at least once, but can be longer (e.g.: *'Aphex Twin'* => **'Next Heap With'**)
5. If you enter at least 1 extra symbol, not present in original sentence, the program will pick that up and show you a warning.
6. If you use all the characters from original sentence, the program will show you a success message!

~~Next steps:~~

1. ~~Animations.~~
2. ~~Toggle for ideal and non-ideal anagrams (non-ideal anagrams can use extra characters).~~

**All additional steps are completed! Enjoy the project!**
