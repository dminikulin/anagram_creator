# Check your anagram!

Little program for anagram checking, written with React + TS + Tailwind.

How to use:

1. Enter your original sentence. This will be the basis of your anagram.
2. After you submit the sentence, a new field will appear. This is where you enter the anagram you have in mind. By default, in the anagram each letter of your original sentence is used only once. Basic punctuation and spaces are ignored.
3. If you want to have repeating characters in your sentence, click "Allow repeats". This way, the characters from your original sentence can appear in the anagram more than once.
4. The characters not present in original sentence are not allowed in the anagram.
5. If you want to start over, just press "Reset".
